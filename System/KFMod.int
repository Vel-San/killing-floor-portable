KFHints=("Aiming for the head is a good idea. If you score a critical headshot, you can remove a Specimen's head, rendering them unable to use special abilities, and increasing any further damage they take.","While you can use your medical syringe to heal your own wounds, it is far more effective when used on a team mate.","The Fleshpound. Shooting him with small weapons just makes him mad. Think big, powerful weapons for this one!","Patriarch addendum: Did we forget to brief you? Yes, it seems he can cloak when he needs to heal. Luckily, only a couple of times in his short, angry life.","The Patriarch. This is the Big One. Chain-gun. Rockets. And vicious up close, too!","The Scrake. Yes, that IS a chainsaw he's carrying...  nothing subtle about him!","The Crawler. Interesting attempt to merge human and arachnid genes. Sort-of worked, too - these little nasties have a habit of appearing in all sorts of strange places!","The Bloat. Not too hard to kill, but its bile is poisonous, so make sure you keep out of range!","Your movement speed is affected by your weight total. You can also run faster carrying a melee weapon than a gun.","Bloats will explode in a shower of acidic goop when they die. Keep your distance when taking them down.","The Stalker will be largely cloaked and very hard to see, until she is close enough to gut you. Listen carefully for her.","The Trader will only open her shop for a brief time when the coast is clear. You'll have to find where she is situated in each map, and plan your shopping beforehand.","The Gorefast - tends to live up to its name, so watch out for it speeding in towards you.","The Clot is not that dangerous - but does have a nasty habit of grappling you and not letting you get away, so keep him at a distance.","The Siren is a real screamer. Very nasty. Her screams actually hurt - and they'll destroy grenades and rockets in mid-air!")

Description="The premise is simple: you (and, hopefully, your team) have been flown in to 'cleanse' this area of specimens. The only things moving are specimens. They will launch at you in waves. Kill them. All of them. Any and every way you can. We'll even pay you a bounty for it! Between waves, you should be able to find the merc Trader lurking in some safe spot. She'll trade your bounty for ammo, equipment and Bigger Guns. Trust me - you're going to need them! If you can survive all the waves, you'll have to top the so-called Patriarch to finish the job. Don't worry about finding him - HE will come looking for YOU!"
